<p>So, last Sunday my parents made me go to church ,which made me really mad because my parents don't let me play Among Us in church. </p>

<p>We took our seats and the priest was up front talking about "salvation" and "holiness" or whatever. Same thing as last week. </p>

<p>But then, he said something that really caught me off guard. He spoke of a man who goes by the name of "Jesus." </p>

<p>"Jesus." </p>
 
<p>"JeSUS."</p>

<p>No way. I could not believe what I was hearing.</p>

<p>Endorphins were rushing to my brain and my body began to shiver as I let out a quiet moan.</p>

<p>If you didn't catch on by now, the word "Jesus" has "SUS" in it, which is a reference to the popular video game "Among Us."</p>

<p>"WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

<p>I screamed louder than I ever have in my life. My words echoed throughout the room for five seconds before fading into complete silence.</p>

<p>Everyone was staring at me as I had a huge grin on my face, perfectly replicating the face from the "when the imposter is sus" meme (Google it if you don't know what it is.)</p>

<p>They all had this look on their faces as if I had just slaughtered 7,924 Afghanian children.</p>

<p>"Why do you all have that look on your faces? Did someone do a Fortnite dance?"</p>

<p>And there was still complete silence. I actually had to make sure I wasn't wearing my noise cancelling headphones that I always wear while playing Among Us. I could not believe that not one person in the room was dying of laughter!!</p>

<p>"Young man, please be quiet" said the priest.</p>

<p>He was literally the one who made the Among Us reference in the first place. What's his problem?</p>

<p>"THAT'S NOT VERY WHOLESOME!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

<p>This guy was definitely the imposter. There's no way he couldn't be.</p>

<p>I Naruto ran faster than anyone has ever Naruto ran before. Even Naruto himself would be proud of me.</p>

<p>As I was making my way up to the imposter, the security guard was chasing after me!</p>

<p>I had to think fast.</p>

<p>After being chased around the room for two minutes, I hastily undid my pants and peed in the security guard's eyes. As he was being blinded by my pee, he was stumbling around and bumped into the wall very hard.</p>

<p>A crucifix fell off the wall and impaled his stupid, ugly fat head. He fell and a pool of blood soon formed around him.</p>

<p>Everyone in the church was screaming and running out the door. I slammed my hand down on the crucifix, replicating the button you press in Among Us, which drove the crucifix further into his skull.</p>

<p>"EMERGENCY MEETING!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

<p>No one laughed. They were too busy screaming to notice. Whatever.</p>

<p>I stripped completely naked and went up to the priest. I replicated the Big Chungus pose with 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>"You probably don't even use Reddit. That's not very keanu chungus wholesome 100 of you. Go subscribe to r/atheism."</p>

<p>The priest had a look of shock on his face when I said that. The kind of face one would make if they caught their beloved child playing Fortnite.</p>

<p>He held a cross in front of himself and started talking about "possession" and "demons." He obviously doesn't know how to play Among Us so naturally, I felt bad for him.</p>

<p>But he was still the imposter.</p>

<p>I grabbed him and threw him across the church, sending him crashing through the window and slammed against the street outside. A car ran over his head, causing his brain and skull fragments to splatter everywhere.</p>

<p>Then, I heard sirens and a helicopter flying around above the church. I went upstairs to the roof to check out what was going on.</p>

<p>"This is the police! Get down from the roof now or we will shoot!"</p>

<p>This guy is so sus, let me tell ya.</p>

<p>Obviously, I was not going to listen to an imposter so I was Naruto running around the roof. Bullets from the helicopter were raining down from above but none of them hit me since I was Naruto running so fast.</p>

<p>"Dammit, I can't hit him!"</p>

<p>I knew I had him beat then.</p>

<p>So, I pulled out my gun (I always keep a glock in my foreskin so I can pull the Among Us death animation when I lose my virginity because I know it makes girls horny.)</p>

<p>I shot at the helicopter and it started spinning out of control and crashed into the front of the church, causing a huge explosion.</p>

<p>The roof started sliding off from the building, which landed on the cop cars and killed 8 cops. This also flung me into the street and I broke my foot, which was very sus.</p>

<p>I limped all the way to the woods where I am now hiding and writing this. I will update as soon as I can but I need to get out of here soon because I can hear people looking for me.</p>
